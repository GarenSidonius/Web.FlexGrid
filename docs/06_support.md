##6.2	Crash Reports
Crash reports provide details about Flex Grid errors that crashes the application. 
Crash reports are in files with names that are prefixed with 'Crashreport_' followed by the current date (i.e., 'Crashreport_yyyymmdd.txt.log'). 
These files can be located in the following directory:

    C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Wild Gums\Flex Grid

The following image shows the location and contents of this folder when there are no crash reports present:
